# pneumonia-detection
This project develops an AI system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images, classifying them as "Normal" or "Pneumonia." It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, aiming to assist healthcare clinicians in pneumonia detection.
